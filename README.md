ID ASG1 Chong Yu Xiang - Band Website
    The band I have chosen to work on is the J-pop band YOASOBI
    I have chosen this band because I like their music and with their live concert in Singapore coming up, I wanted to make a website with features connected to the live event

Design Process
    The website is designed for both fans of YOASOBI and newcomers
    The website aims to introduce newcomers to YOASOBI and allow fans to keep up to date on latest news
    The website has to be smooth and convenient to navigate
-User Stories-
    As a YOASOBI fan, I would like to find the live event website so that I can book my ticket for the concert
    As someone who does not know about YOASOBI, I would like to find basic information about them so that i can be introduced to them
